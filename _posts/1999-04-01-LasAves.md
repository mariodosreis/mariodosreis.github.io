title:   "Los Roques and Las Aves"
author: "Mario dos Reis"

When I was little, in the Easter of 1983, my dad took us sailing to Los Roques, a Caribbean atoll 63 NM off the northen coast of Venezuela. The crossing is done overnight, and so we left Caraballeda in the late afternoon aboard Ritmo D'Accord, my dad's Tartan 37 sailboat. As a little kid the trip impressed me very much. I remember the montains of the northern coast dissappearing in the distance as we sailed away, with the dark ocean swell rolling by. I remember my dad giving me a flying fish that had crash landed and died on deck. 

In the mid-morning we approached the islands, and the water changed into a variaty of blue tones. It was very pretty and I had never seen seawater like that. We anchored in a lagoon. I remember snorkelling in crystal clear water over pristine white sand, only interrupted occassionally by giant brain corals. I remember snorkelling with my dad on a forest of corals, a large barracuda swimming by, an otherland that I have never seen again.

I never visited Los Roques again. The upkeep of the Tartan was high and my dad sold it not long after the Roques trip. Years later, my dad bought a J24, called Eos and, although much less confortable than the Tartan, it provided us with many weekends of beautiful sailing along the Venezuelan coast. However, work meant my dad had less and less time to sail, and I eventually started university which kept me busy. Towards the end of my degree, I became keen on sailing again and harassed my dad on a visit to Las Aves, two atolls west of Los Roques which are pristine and uninhabited, and so in Easter 1999 we went there.

At the time Eos was moored in La Cuevita, in Morrocoy National Park, in Western Venezuela. On the first day we set sail for Cayo Sombrero, the Easternmost key in the park. We had a pleasant night moored on the lee of the key. I would entertain myself by passing my hand on the water and seeing it fluoresce in the dark. At midday we left the pretty palm-lined key for the open waters. Las Aves are located 72 NM north-east of Morrocoy. The wind was coming from the north-east, and so we sailed on the port tack, south east towards Turiamo bay. It was pretty seeing the rainforest-covered mountains of Turiamo in the afternoon sun. The mountains are part of Henri Pittier National Park, and the highest peaks raise above 2,000m (6,000 ft). In the late afternoon, once we had gained a favorable angle to the wind, we turned north and sailed on the starboard tack to the islands.

It was four of us on the boat: my dad, myself, Bernardo, and Federico. Bernardo got badly seasick and went inside to sleep. The day had been hot and when the bow went through a wave, we would be splashed and the water felt very chilly in the wind. As it got dark, the situation reversed: the air felt cold in the wind, and the water splashes felt nice and warm. 

Once it got late at night, we implemented a rotation system: one person at the helm, a second person in the cockpit keeping company, and the third having a nap in the cabin. Bernardo was still out of action and deeply asleep, and could not help. After one hour the helm would surrender the tiller and move into the cabin, and the sleeper would come out and keep company to the new helm. At 1am was my turn for a nap, and had to go to the forecabin as Bernardo was in the windward berth. It was difficult to sleep windward at the bow, so I would try to use my hand against the mast to keep some balance. At 2am I was woken by Federico and went out to keep my dad company, who was now at the helm. However, once I got out my dad said he was very tired and wanted to sleep "just 15 minutes". He never came back out.

What happened after was one of the most memorable moments of my life. I steered the little boat, under a full moon, for over four hours while everybody else slept inside. I would see the dark sea rolling towards the boat, the dark clouds in the horizon and the moon slowly setting to the west. As the moon started to get closer to the horizon, the black seas started shimmering with red. I was very excited waiting to see the moon going over the horizon, expecting an spectacle of color, but the dark clouds put an end to the show. I never saw a moonset again. I was very tired, but felt very proud that I was the only one left standing.

Around 6am daylight started to break out, and a rejuvenated Bernardo came out of the cabin. He took over the helm and I gave him the bearing to the islands. I slept soundly for over three hours until I was woken up by Bernardo, who wanted me to check in the GPS how far the islands were. From within the cabin I switched on the device and checked, and was puzzled as the GPS indicated the islands were only 45 minutes away. I lifted my head out of the cabin and turn it around slowly. And yes, the islands were right in front of us. It became clear Bernardo was very short sighted. I was also very happy that I had mantained a perfect bearing during the night, as the islands were dead ahead. 

After 22h and 113 NM, we had finally reached Las Aves. Las Aves is made up of two atolls: Aves de Sotavento (Leeward Aves) and Aves de Barlovento (Windward Aves). We arrived at the lee atoll and entered the lagoon from the West. When approaching the lagoon I saw again the beautiful blue color changes I had seen at Los Roques 16 years before. After anchoring, I put on my mask I dived right into the water. When reaching the bottom I found a large botuto shell, and upon lifting it, was surprised to discover an eye next to a dark claw peering back at me. The botuto (_Aligas gigas_) is a very large sea snail native to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. It is highly sought for its tasty meat. In Venezuela, the species is almost extinct due to overfishing. It is common to find the empty shells along the coast, but I had never seen one alive before. I put it on the sand carefully when I noticed another one barely a meter away. As I lifted my head I saw another and another and another. Every meter or so, dissappearing across the underwater horizon, hundreds of adult botutos lay pacefully grazing on the seaweeds. Such a high density for this species is testament to how pristine these islands are.

Later the coastguard visited the boat and checked our papers. They suggested we move further north and anchor on the lee of Cayo Curricai, where a couple of larger yatchs were moored. We moved there in the afternoon. On the key there was a small shack were lobster fishermen live during the fishing season. They catch two lobster species, the spiny lobster (_Panulirus argus_), with comercial value and which they sell in nearby Bonaire, and another, smaller one which they catch for themselves. They gifted us one of the latter ones (which they even cooked for us) and it tasted absolutely delicious. Apart from the fishermen and the coastguard, nobody else lives in the lee atoll. We had a pleasant day with glorious weather, swimming to the beach, and strolling along the pristine sand.

The next day we set off for the windward atoll. We sailed north, and rounded to the east, making sure we left a few miles of clearance of the northestern reef that borders the lee atoll. With Bernardo at the helm I decided to try my luck at finishg. We didn't have any lures so I cut a beer can and made a little aluminum fish, which I then passed through a hook. We didn't have lead weights either so I took a stainless still bolt and attached it to the line. To my surprise, a few minutes later a little tuna got caught on the line. The boat was sailing very fast and the fish, perhaps four pounds or so, was being draggged out of the water, bouncing and spinning in the air. I asked Bernardo to stop the boat to reel the fish in but Bernardo was worried that the wind would push us to the reef. But the reef was well over a mile away and there was no danger. Nonetheless Bearnardo kept the course steady and fast and the line broke and we lost the fish, and I was dissappointed as it would have been the biggest fish I had ever caught.

Later we entered the desolated windard atoll. There was just one large power yatch anchored in the lagoon. A rich looking guy appeared to order some servants about, who would run up and down the yatch. We had another pleasant day of swimming and exploration of the sothern island of the atoll, which has an old and rusty lighthouse and the ruins of an old hermit house and boat. We did some snorkelling and with the tender explored a little mangrove forest full of birds. Later a fishing boat from Margarita island arrived. The yatchman's servants threw some ballons into the water and the yatchman proceeded to blow them with a handgun. The margariteños kept well away from the yatch, but they did pay us a visit and told us about the old hermit that lived on the island.

The next day we set sail south to Caraballeda, the new home of Eos. The trip back was quick and pleasant with the wind on the beam, however, just before arriving we got becalmed, so the final stretch was slow. A year later I moved to England and never had the opportunity to sail to a desolate tropical island again.
