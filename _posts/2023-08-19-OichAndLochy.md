title:   "Scotland's Great Glen: Across Loch Lochy, Loch Oich, and the Caledonian Canal"
author: "Mario dos Reis"

Nine years ago I bought myself a single-seater, foldable Klepper T9 kayak. The T9 is a touring kayak that was in production between the 50's and the 70's. It is considered by many the best of Klepper's foldable kayaks due to its stability, speed, and payload (~180 Kg). Although I used the kayak a lot for day trips in the River Thames around Oxford, I never really had the time to go on a proper, multi-day solo expedition. 

I finally had the time for a proper expedition in early August 2023, so I decided to visit Scotland's Great Glen Canoe Trail, which starts at Fort William, in Scotland's West coast, and cuts through along the Caledonian canal and Lochs Lochy, Oich, and Ness, until finally reaching Inverness on the East coast of the country.

I left South Oxfordshire on the 1st of Aug at 6am in the morning. After a 9h drive, I arrived at Corpach, Fort William, where the canoe trail begins. You are required to register online, at the [Canoe Trail website](http://greatglencanoetrail.info/index.html), five working days before starting the trail. At Corpach, you can visit the sea lock offices and rent a toilet key for Â£10. If the lock keeper is out, you can call them using the mobile number posted on the lock office's door. Luckly for me, the keeper arrived as I was approaching the office. The keeper took my details and provided the toilet key. I asked about parking, and was told that I could leave my car at Banavie carpark (NN 11189 76953) despite the "no overnight parking" signs. I was also told there is a small bay for dropping canoe/kayaks at the top of the Banavie locks (NN 11608 77271) but with limited parking spaces available. When I got to the canoe drop bay it was literally empty so it was not problem parking the car there.

After assembling the kayak, checking the gear and packing it into the kayak, I was on my way along the Caledonian canal. It was a pleasant evening with no wind and no waves. The water was a pretty mirror reflecting the surrounding mountains. The canal is popular with sailing yatchs and motorise craft that do the crossing from Fort William to Inverness. However the canal was not busy at all and there were very few large boats going about.

After 7.6 Km of paddling I stopped at Moy Bridge, where a camping and picnic area are available. Along the canal you must camp only on designated spots. Along the lochs, you are allowed to wildcamp according to [Scotland's access code](https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/). I soon discovered there are no toilets at Moy. About 2 Km upstream, there are additional camping spots at the Gairlochy locks with toilet access. I was already settled with the tent up so there was no point in re-packing and moving on that day. Moy was incredibly quiet, with just a few walkers and cyclist passing by occassionally along the Great Glen trail. Moy Swing Bridge was built in the 1800's to give a farmer access to his land after it got cut through with the construction of the canal. There is still a farmer managing the land and the bridge is still in use. The lock keepers must travel down to the bridge and swing it open to let large boats through, and then must close it again if needed by the farmer. When I got there the farmer's cows where grazing on the other side of the canal. After a tasty seafood paella dinner I had a reasonable night's sleep.

In the morning I packed up and quickly reached the Gairlochy locks. Here you need to portage the kayak around the lochs and put them back in at the mouth of Loch Lochy. Small craft are not allowed to use any locks along the canal and so you must portage all of them. A northesterly headwind picked up substantially in the morning slowing the paddling. This is unusual as the prevailing winds come from the southwest, and this is the reason why the preferred direction of travel for canoists is West to East. Once I reached Loch Lochy I met an uncomfortable succession of headwaves and strong winds that made paddling very difficult. I hugged the northwest margin of the lock and aimed for a small head of land to try and land out of the waves. I barely managed to paddled 1 Km into Loch Lochy against those headwinds. Loch Lochy is 15 Km long and paddling in those conditions would be a big struggle and potentially dangerous. After stopping I checked the weather forecast: average winds of 10-12 mph with gusts of over 20 mph for the remaining of the day.

It was still way too early in the morning and I really didn't have much to do. So I went exploring this section of coast which is rather pretty: a single beach lined up with evergreen forests. I found a gap in the vegetation that led to a nice camping spot. I hanged my hammock and had a rest. Forecast for the night was rain, so I set up the tent as well. In the afternoon the overcast sky gave way to warm sunshine but still strong winds. Here Loch Lochy has a bulge on its west side, and paddlers have two choices: hug the coast around the bulge on the west, which lengthens the trip, or cross the bay directly across. With such headwinds, neither option was feasible. Hugging the west coast would have meant being relentessly pushed to shore by cross waves and winds. Going straight through the bay would mean battling the headwind and waves, and if you were to capsize, you'd be far from shore.

Later in the evening the winds died down and the midges finally made an appereance. A bit bothersome but not too bad. The air got chilly and I made my way into the tent after a nice seafood pasta dinner, accompanied by rye bread and sausisson. In the morning I checked everything carefully as the previous day I found a rather large tick crawling on the outside of the tent. Scotland has a deer problem and with the deer come the ticks. After packing I was in the water in no time, with a nice, gentle tail wind pushing me along under bright skyes. I passed a large guided canoe group and made a swift, straight crossing of the bay. With the tail wind I cruised at about 6 Km/h reaching the end of the loch at midday. Here you have to portage Laggan locks before continuing along the Caledonian canal. A stop for a Manchego, rye bread and saussison lunch was in order, and at the lock I finally had the opportunity to use my toilet key.

This section of canal is short but very pretty, as it is lined up by very tall trees. At the end you reach the A82 swing bridge and then enter into Loch Oich, which is narrow and very pretty. Far ahead you reach a long but very thin island with tall trees that divides the lake in two. Soon after you have the Leitirfearn meadow (NH 32511 01283), which has a camping spot with composting toilets (no key needed) next to an abandoned, boarded-up house. I stopped at Leiterfearn and did a little exploring. The place is very charming and I was pondering what to do. My intention was never to reach Inverness, as that would mean travelling back on public transport with 30 Kg of foldable kayak and gear. Intead, I was aiming to paddle the Glen to around its midway, and then paddle back to Fort William. I was thinking to reach Kitra lock, with a camping spot and toilets, on the Caledonian canal section linking Loch Oich and Loch Ness. However I realised that to get there, I would have to portage Cullochy loch, then reach Kitra loch and also take the kayak out of the water for the campnight. Too much work. So instead, I decided to paddle to the Oich river weir, at the north end of Loch Oich, and then paddle back to Leiterfearn to pass the night. The evening paddle was nice and soon I heard the thundering noise of the Oich weir. As I turned around the sky became overcast and the wind picked up, and I soon found myself paddling against swift headwinds in a light drizzle on my way back to Leitirfearn. 

The night in Leitirfearn was pleasant, with midges making a couple of not too bothersome appereances. A large canoe group arrived but camped further up the meadow. The place is really big and I could neither hear nor see them. A line of charming trees stood next to the water and so I was able to hang the hammock for an evening rest. However, the night was spent in the tent due to the cold and the midges. In the tent I found a few tiny ticks which I promptly disposed of. I must have picked them up on my trousers when I walked on the tall grasses at the back of the meadow. Must be more careful next time.

Although the Glen is in general stunningly pretty, it does not feel remote. The locks, boats, towns, and the busy A82 road, which runs next to the lochs in some sections, remind you this is a partially urban environemnt. There is also reasonably good 4G mobile reception along the way.

In the morning I packed up and paddled back along very quiet waters. Reached Laggan locks relatively quickly, and soon found myself tackling the open waters of Loch Lochy, but this time with against a swift headwind, although nowhere near as bad as the one on the second day. Progress was much slower, about 3 Km/h, half the speed of the way in. Made several rest stops along the north shore, to break up the monotony of the struggle. I stopped at the new campspot (NN 24309 92236) near Glas-dhoire. The Glas-dhoire campspot itself is closed due to works in the area. The new campspot is signalled by a statue of a canoe with paddling bears.

After what felt like an immensely long time I reached the end of Loch Lochy. After portaging Gairlochy locks, I regained the canal and progress was much swifter without the head waves. I camped back at Moy as Gairlochy was quite busy with other campers. Moy in contrast, was a sea of tranquility. On the other side of the canal two minks playfully explored the rocks next to the water, perphaps searching for voles.

In the morning, with no wind, the water was again a mirror unto the glen. A quick paddle took me back to the car where I repacked everything and got ready for the way back. As I arrived a couple of nice chaps where setting up their inflatable canoe and were on their way to Fort Augustus, at the southern end of Loch Ness. Their inflatable canoe was very large and sophisticated, and they told me they had rented it a Decathlon in Glasgow for their three-day trip. 

From Banavie I made the short drive back to Corpach to return the key, but no before having a nice hot shower in the tower blocks next to the lock office. After this it was a long drive back to Oxfordshire under very heavy rains. Nonetheless, managed to do the trip in about 9h and still arrived under daylight. The total paddled distance was 72 Km, at a roughly average speed of 4 Km/h. A memorable trip surely to be repeated.
